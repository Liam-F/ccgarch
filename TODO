- Creating a procedure for estimating an STCC-GARCH model.
- Making help files more informative, eg, adding more examples.
- Allowing for negative parameters.
- Modelling the conditional mean part.
- Creating procedures for diagnostic testing.
- Adding functions for graphics, eg plotting the date, etc.
- Improving the user interface.
